## Project Build Instructions

Make sure you've [`git`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) & [`nodejs`](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your system.

Open terminal and follow these steps;

- Step 1: Clone the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ekas/react-apps.git
```

You should now see a `EventCalendar2-react` folder in your present working directory. Let's change directory to it.

```bash
cd EventCalendar2-react/
```

- Step 2: Install dependencies.

This will use `npm` that is included with `nodejs` to install project dependencies.

- Step 3: Start the project.

```bash
npm run start
```

This will run a local instance of the application http://localhost:3000/

- Step 4: To deploy the webpage over to remote servers of Zeit. For this you need the Zeit CLI. Run the following commands to do so.

```bash
npm i -g now
now
